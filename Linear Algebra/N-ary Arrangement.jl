#### N-ary Arrangement

# Input a Vector as Sequence:
A = [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]
println("The sequence is ",A)

# Print the elements number of the Vector:
println("The number of elements is ",length(A))

# initialize the Order Number:
o = Int64(0)

# initialize the Reverse Order Number:
t = Int64(0)

# Calculus the Order Number:
for i in 1:length(A)
    for j in 1:
